* Car class should have the following attributes & methods
*
* Attributes:
* color (String), maxSpeed (int), acceleration (int), tyreFriction (int), isEngineStarted (boolean), currentSpeed (int)
*
* Methods:
* startEngine, stopEngine, accelerate
*
* accelerate Method
* When this method is called, 
*   If car engine is off, the current speed of the car should not increase
*   If car engine is on, the current speed of the car should increase according to its acceleration value
*   print the message "Car has not started yet" if the car engine is off
*   Any car cannot accelerate more than its maxSpeed
*
* When a new car is created, the engine should be off by default and current speed should be 0
*
* Implement the Car class appropriately
