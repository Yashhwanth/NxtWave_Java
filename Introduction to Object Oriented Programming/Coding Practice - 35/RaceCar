/**
* RaceCar class should have the following attributes & methods
*
* Old Attributes:
*   color (String), maxSpeed (int), acceleration (int), tyreFriction (int), isEngineStarted (boolean), currentSpeed (int)
* New Attributes:
*     nitro (int)
*
* Old Methods:
*   startEngine, stopEngine, accelerate, applyBrakes, soundHorn
* 
* Override Methods:
*   soundHorn:
*       - Print "Peep Peep\nBeep Beep" if raceCar engine is on
*       - Print "Car has not started yet" if raceCar engine is off
*   accelerate:
*       - When car accelerates
*           if nitro points are available, the currentSpeed will increase by 20 within max limits
*           and the nitro will get reduced by 1
*           Note: When we accelerate, the currentSpeed should increase based on the nitro and 
*                  the acceleration value provided (currentSpeed = currentSpeed + nitroSpeed + acceleration)
*
* When a new RaceCar is created, the engine should be off by default and currentSpeed should be 0


* Implement the Car and RaceCar class appropriately
* Inherit the Car class into RaceCar class and override the methods which have extra features
